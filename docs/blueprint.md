# **App Name**: SensorStream

## Core Features:

- Live Sensor Data: Display live sensor data from MPU6050 (accelerometer and gyroscope), SW420 vibration sensor, and GPS.
- Data Visualization: Visualize sensor data using graphs: acceleration (x, y, z), gyroscope (x, y, z), rate of change of acceleration, and GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude).
- CSV Export: Allow users to download all sensor data in CSV format.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#1A237E) for a professional and data-focused feel.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#EEEEEE) for backgrounds and neutral elements.
- Accent: Teal (#00ACC1) for interactive elements and data highlights.
- Clean and responsive layout with clear sections for each sensor and its corresponding graph.
- Use simple, recognizable icons to represent each sensor type and data dimension.
- Subtle animations for graph updates and data loading to improve user experience.

## Original User Request:
i need a realtime data web app with three sensors readings, (mpu6050 : accelerometer sensor. sw420 vibration sensor, GPS). could you please give me the step by step instruction to create it in fire store studio. in that webpage i need the live sensors data, with graph them, and able to download all the data in a CSV file format. graphs (acceleration x,y,z ; gyro x, y, z; Da/dt (change in acceleration; gps (latitude. loguititude). my microcontroller is esp32; i will give you the reference code.
